## Airgapped GPG Encrypted Messaging using QR-Coded Video 
This help file is not complete.  
It is under construction.  

Works on Raspberry Pi and other linux devices.  

Text files are encrypted and then passed across the airgap as a parade of QR-Codes displayed on the touch screen.  
Should work with any kind of file but to date have only tested with text files.  

Requires a raspberry pi setup as a PrivateKeyVault.  
[We show you how to make your own PrivateKeyVault here](https://github.com/johnshearing/PrivateKeyVault)  

To use this code, just clone the repository into a directory which is included in your path variable.  
Then grant executible permissions to all the scripts.  

Finally open a terminal window and type `menu`.  
This starts the PrivateKeyVault application which provides you with a full menu of services provided with the device.
