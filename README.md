Text files are encrypted and then passed across the airgap as a parade of QR-Codes displayed on the touch screen.  
Should work with any kind of file but to date have only tested with text files.  

Requires a raspberry pi setup as a PrivateKeyVault.  
[We show you how to make your own PrivateKeyVault here](https://github.com/johnshearing/PrivateKeyVault)  

To use this code, just clone the repository and then copy all the files into a directory which is included in your path variable.  
Then grant executible permissions to all the files.  

Finally open a terminal window and type `menu`.
